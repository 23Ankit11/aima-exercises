[Exercise 18.7 \[nonnegative-gain-exercise\]](18-7/)

\[nonnegative-gain-exercise\]Suppose that an attribute splits the set of
examples $E$ into subsets $E_{{k}}$ and that each subset has $p_{{k}}$
positive examples and $n_{{k}}$ negative examples. Show that the
attribute has strictly positive information gain unless the ratio
$p_{{k}}/(p_{{k}}+n_{{k}})$ is the same for all ${{k}}$.
