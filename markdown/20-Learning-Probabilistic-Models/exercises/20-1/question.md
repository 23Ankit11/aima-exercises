[Exercise 20.1 \[bayes-candy-exercise\]](20-1/)

The data used for
Figure [bayes-candy-figure](#/) on page [bayes-candy-figure](#/) can be
viewed as being generated by $h_5$. For each of the other four
hypotheses, generate a data set of length 100 and plot the corresponding
graphs for $P(h_i{{\,|\,}}{d}_1,\ldots,{d}_N)$ and
$P({D}_{N+1}{{\,=\,}}{lime}{{\,|\,}}{d}_1,\ldots,{d}_N)$. Comment on
your results.
