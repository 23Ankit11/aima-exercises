[Exercise 2.14 \[vacuum-bump-exercise\]](2-14/)

Repeat Exercise [vacuum-unknown-geog-exercise](2-13/) for the case in
which the location sensor is replaced with a “bump” sensor that detects
the agent’s attempts to move into an obstacle or to cross the boundaries
of the environment. Suppose the bump sensor stops working; how should
the agent behave?
